      <h3>Andrew H.</h3>
      <p>
        First off - these are good people. Family owned business, which
        generally means they care about what they do. These guys wrapped fragile
        items, used blanks to protect against scratching furniture and floors,
        they asked what needed to go and very strategically packed the truck.
        They quoted a flat rate and stayed true to their word. At the unload -
        they again took care of it all, asked where I wanted everything to go,
        and took to the time to fit large furniture into rooms that were not
        easy to get big pieces into. I highly recommend for anyone who is looked
        for quality movers that care about the job they do. They deserve ample
        business! -Andrew H.
